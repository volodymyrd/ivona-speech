-how long it took you to read
-what it is about

And explain why you have enjoyed reading it.


Okay, I'm going to tell you about my favorite book – or books – Harry Potter, because it's a series. This  book tells
us about the adventures of a young wizard called Harry Potter – and his friends, Hermoine and Ron. I've read all
the novels in the series, more than twice I assure you, and I guess it took me a few weeks to read each one
from cover to cover.

The reason why I like these books is because, well, I've always been a great fan of fantasies. The author writes is a
very vivid way. She describes everything so well, it gets my imagination going – I really can imagine the fantasy world
that the main characters live in.

I think that there are also some deeper themes that run through these books, like, you know, death, survival, love,
oppression.

And every person I know has interpreted them in totally different ways, I really enjoy the adventures in each series –
in each book. I love the fact that each book connects to the next one, and after you've read all seven, you can really
see that they whole story was just well thought through.

Obviously, I've seen all the films as well as, which were quite enjoyable, especially that you could just … what you
had in your imagination, you could finally see on the screen. And I'm very disappointed that the whole adventure is
all over. That's it.
