and explain why you like this family

Well, besides my own family, I always consider my uncle’s family the second home. Actually, the time I lived with them
was even longer than with my parents. This is because I left my  home village when I was only 10 years old to live at my
uncle’s house in a town for better studying condition.

In addition to my uncle and aunt, I have two cousins, both of them are boys and younger than me. So we were a big family
with 5 people but only my aunt is a woman. My uncle, the vice mayor of the town, is a thorough, conscientious and sometimes
austere man who always cared for me and my cousins but also was willing to punish us for our wrongdoing. My aunt, on
the contrary, is a gentle and pleasant woman. As a teacher, she treated me and the boys equally and usually taught us
thoughtful lessons, no matter how mischievous we were. I got along very well with my two cousins and we were a funny and
boisterous team although there were sometimes several little conflicts between us.

I lived in my uncle’s house for some 5 years before moving to a big city for high school study. That’s why this family is
very important to me. It was my memorable childhood, full of joy and fun. Until now, I still remember numerous stories
about us, I and my cousins are just like intimate brothers and my uncle and aunt treated me just as their son.
More importantly, I have been trained to be a good student thanks to the discipline of my uncle and the kindness of
my aunt. You know, I used to be such a naughty boy that my parents had no way to cope with my disobedience. so now
looking backward, I am really grateful to them for my upbringing.

To sum up, my uncle’s family is always an unforgettable part of my life
