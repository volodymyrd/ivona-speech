A family member

Right, that's quite a tough one. I like all my family members but I'm going to talk about my uncle.
He's achieved quite a lot in his life, mainly in business. He started his own company during the 1990s,
which was a pretty good time to start a business in my country.
Now, he runs a few pizza places in my city... but that's not the reason why I like him, obviously.
